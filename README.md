# Java-Interview-Questions
My Java files that solve interview questions.

This java file is supposed to solve the famous FizzBuzz interview Question. At first I solved it using util.java.ArrayList, but I realized I can solve it much easier and with only beginner-level notions such as loops or ifs. Hope this helps clarify whatever questions you have!
